# Memory Bank: Active Context

## Current Focus

No active task. IDLE mode.

## Previous Context

Phase 2 (AgentSkill + FileRule) planning is complete, but implementation is blocked pending the `@a16n/glob-hook` package.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Build `@a16n/glob-hook` package (see `planning/glob-hook/`)
2. Resume Phase 2 implementation with FileRule → Claude hooks support
