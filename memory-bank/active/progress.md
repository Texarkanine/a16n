# Progress

Migrate Cursor plugin emission from deprecated Commands to Agent Skills (disable-model-invocation).

**Complexity:** Level 3

## 2026-05-10 - COMPLEXITY-ANALYSIS - COMPLETE

* Work completed
    - Created ephemeral memory bank files (projectbrief.md, activeContext.md, tasks.md, progress.md) per Niko L3 initialization
    - Classified task as Level 3 using decision tree (enhancement affecting emit + tests + fixtures; multiple components)
    - Validated intent and confirmed with operator
* Decisions made
    - Follow full L3 workflow: Plan → Preflight → Build (via /niko-build) → QA → Reflect
    - Use Claude plugin's ManualPrompt → Skill mapping as reference for format
* Insights
    - Non-roundtrip note for Commands is important for discover/emit asymmetry
    - TDD mandatory per workspace rules; tests first for any implementation changes

## 2026-05-10 - PLAN - IN-PROGRESS (resumed)

* Work completed
    - Re-invoked /niko on incomplete Standalone task with no new input → correctly routed to Resume Workflow (Step 6)
    - Confirmed Level 3, current phase PLAN
    - Updated activeContext.md for resumption
* Work to be done next
    - Execute remaining Plan phase steps: Component Analysis, Open Questions, TDD test planning, Implementation Plan, Challenges, Tech Validation, Generate Plan Report
    - Update tasks.md with full plan at end of phase
    - Commit before transitioning out of Plan
